## Protect

This package offers production-ready essential protection that quickly and automatically adds additional security and tamper detection to your code without any manual configuration.

To run protection, add the following code at the end of your build:

```
const {protect} = require('protect-web');
const blueprint = {
    targets: {
        main: {
            "input": "./dist",
            "outputDirectory": "./dist_protected"
        }
    }
}
protect(blueprint).then((output) => {
    console.log(output.stdout);
    console.error(output.stderr);
}).catch((err) => {
    console.error(err.message);
});
```

Notice the object called `blueprint`. To apply essential protection, you only need to modify the values of `"input"` and `"outputDirectory"`, where `"./dist"` is the directory that contains your input files and `"./dist_protected"` is the directory where the final protected files will appear.

However, you can further customize your protection by modifying the `blueprint` object. For instructions, see the *Digital.ai Web App Protection* online help, which is available from Digital.ai.


### Protect with Webpack

To run protection within a webpack bundle, add the protection code to `webpack.config.js`.

This example applies essential protection:

```
const {WebpackPlugin} = require('protect-web');
module.exports = {
    plugins : [
        new WebpackPlugin()
    ]
}
```

This example uses a blueprint. If you leave the code as is, it will apply essential protection. However, you can also modify the blueprint as described previously:

```
const {WebpackPlugin} = require('protect-web');
const blueprint = {
    guardConfigurations: {
        config : {
            "debugDetection": {
                "disable": true
            }
        }
    }
}
module.exports = {
    plugins : [
        new WebpackPlugin(blueprint)
    ]
}
```

To see the protection summary, add the ```stats``` field, as follows:

```
const {WebpackPlugin} = require('protect-web');
module.exports = {
    stats: {
        logging: 'log'
    },
    plugins : [
        new WebpackPlugin()
    ]
}
```

You can set the following values for ```logging```:
- none - disable logging
- log - displays errors, warnings, info messages, and log messages
